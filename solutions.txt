Step 1 - Check Local Branch Status
cd C:\Users\axell\Documents\IronHack\1.1-lab-resolving-git-conflicts
git status

Step 3 - Pull Latest Changes From the Remote Branch
git pull origin master

Step 5 - Create Conflicting Changes

Primera parte: 

echo "Hola" >> C:\Users\axell\Documents\IronHack\1.1-lab-resolving-git-conflicts\your-code\about-me.md
git add .
git commit -m "Upload"
git push

Secunda Parte : 
git log

Tercera Parte : 
git reset --hard a7e68a0ca087cb2e8d5340c11551fc6a0b4a7d8b

Cuarta Parte : 
git checkout -b lab-resolving-git-conflicts

Quinta Parte: On the new branch, open your-code/about-me.md, remove everything in the file and replace with an introduction about yourself.

code your-code/about-me.md

# Hi, I'm Axel. I'm from France. I promote Bitcoin and Macro on social medias. 
# After the bootcamp I plan working on data analysis and, on the side, continue promoting bitcoin on social medias
# My carreer goal is to build my own company and own as much bitcoins as I can.

Save


Parte 6 : Now, add the updated your-code/about-me.md file to git and commit and let's assume the ID of the new commit is 338cc201764793e1896744e8fd575e3c09c97a09. Now execute git pull origin master and Git will report you have a conflict that prevents you from merging the branches. Your Git tree currently looks like below.

git add your-code/about-me.md
git commit -m "Introduce myself in about-me.md"
git push origin lab-resolving-git-conflictsV2


Parte 6: Conflicto:  
git pull origin main
From https://github.com/AxelCrypto/1.1-lab-resolving-git-conflicts
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging your-code/about-me.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in your-code/about-me.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.


Step 6 : Step 6 - Resolve Conflicts

code your-code/about-me.md
#I changed the text which conflicted
 
git commit -m "guess it should work"
git push --set-upstream origin lab-resolving-git-conflictsV2

#Checking if all good: 
git pull origin main

Result: "Already up to date."


Step 7 - Commit and push Changes
 git add  your-code/about-me.md
git commit -m "Resolving conflicts with master branch."
git push
Result: "Everything up-to-date"
